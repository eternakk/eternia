# Runtime Cycle

An explanation covering the complete cycle from startup to operation and shutdown behaviors for the runtime environment
of the Eterna Project.

## Overview

The Runtime module is responsible for managing the simulation cycle and time progression within the Eternia system. It
controls the execution of each cycle, ensuring that all components are updated in the correct order and at the
appropriate times.

## RuntimeInterface

The Runtime module implements the `RuntimeInterface`, which is defined in `modules/interfaces.py`. This interface
standardizes how runtime functionality is exposed to other components in the system.

### Key Methods

- `initialize()`: Initialize the runtime module with any required setup.
- `shutdown()`: Perform any cleanup operations when shutting down the module.
- `run_cycle()`: Run a single cycle of the runtime, updating all components.

## Implementation

The Runtime module is implemented in `modules/runtime.py`. It provides a concrete implementation of the
`RuntimeInterface` that handles the actual runtime cycle logic.

## Runtime Cycle

The runtime cycle consists of the following phases:

1. **Initialization**: When the system starts, all modules are initialized through the dependency injection container.
2. **Cycle Execution**: The `run_cycle()` method is called repeatedly to advance the simulation.
3. **Component Updates**: During each cycle, all components are updated in a specific order to ensure consistency.
4. **Event Processing**: Events generated during the cycle are processed and dispatched to subscribers.
5. **State Tracking**: The state of the simulation is tracked and can be saved as checkpoints.
6. **Shutdown**: When the system is shutting down, all modules are given a chance to clean up resources.

## Usage

Other components in the system can interact with the Runtime module through the `RuntimeInterface`, which ensures a
consistent API regardless of the underlying implementation.

```python
from modules.dependency_injection import get_container

# Get the runtime module from the container
container = get_container()
runtime = container.get("runtime")  # Implements RuntimeInterface

# Run a single cycle
runtime.run_cycle()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use the interface**: Always interact with the Runtime module through the `RuntimeInterface` to ensure compatibility
   with future implementations.
2. **Respect the cycle**: Components should respect the runtime cycle and not attempt to perform operations outside of
   their designated update phase.
3. **Handle events**: Components should handle events generated during the runtime cycle appropriately.
