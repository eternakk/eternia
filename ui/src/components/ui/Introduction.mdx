# Eternia UI Component Library

Welcome to the Eternia UI Component Library. This library provides a set of reusable UI components for building consistent user interfaces in the Eternia project.

## Installation

The components are already available in the project and can be imported from the UI components directory:

```tsx
import { Button, Card, Input } from '../components/ui';
```

## Components

The library currently includes the following components:

### Button

A versatile button component with various styles, sizes, and states.

```tsx
<Button variant="primary" size="md" onClick={handleClick}>
  Click Me
</Button>
```

### Card

A card component for displaying content in a contained format.

```tsx
<Card title="Card Title" variant="elevated">
  <p>Card content goes here</p>
</Card>
```

### Input

A form input component with various styles, sizes, and states.

```tsx
<Input 
  label="Email" 
  placeholder="Enter your email" 
  type="email" 
  helperText="We'll never share your email"
/>
```

## Design Principles

The component library follows these design principles:

1. **Consistency**: Components share a consistent API and visual style
2. **Flexibility**: Components are customizable through props
3. **Accessibility**: Components are designed with accessibility in mind
4. **Performance**: Components are optimized for performance
5. **Reusability**: Components are designed to be reused across the application

## Contributing

To add a new component to the library:

1. Create a new component file in the `ui/src/components/ui` directory
2. Export the component from the `ui/src/components/ui/index.ts` file
3. Create a Storybook story file for the component
4. Document the component's props and usage

## Guidelines

All components should:

- Be written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the project's naming conventions
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Be tested thoroughly
- Be accessible to all users
