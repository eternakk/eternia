# Pydantic Compatibility Fix

## Issue

The project was encountering the following error:

```
TypeError: ForwardRef._evaluate() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'recursive_guard'
```

This error occurs because the installed version of pydantic (1.10.7) is not compatible with Python 3.12. In Python 3.12, the `ForwardRef._evaluate()` method requires an additional `recursive_guard` parameter, but pydantic 1.10.7 doesn't account for this.

## Root Cause

There was a discrepancy between the pydantic version specified in requirements.txt (2.4.0) and the version that was actually installed (1.10.7). Additionally, FastAPI 0.95.1 is not compatible with pydantic 2.x, which may have caused dependency resolution issues.

## Solution

The solution involves two steps:

1. Update FastAPI to a version compatible with pydantic 2.x
2. Update the installed dependencies to match the versions specified in requirements.txt

The requirements.txt file has been updated to specify FastAPI 0.103.1, which is compatible with pydantic 2.4.0.

## How to Apply the Fix

Run the provided script to update the dependencies:

```bash
chmod +x update_dependencies.sh
./update_dependencies.sh
```

This script will:
1. Uninstall the problematic packages (fastapi, pydantic, starlette) to avoid conflicts
2. Install the updated versions of FastAPI and pydantic specified in requirements.txt
3. Verify that the correct versions are installed

If you encounter any issues with the update, you may need to recreate your virtual environment:

```bash
# Deactivate current environment
deactivate

# Remove the old environment
rm -rf .venv

# Create a new environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the new environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After running the script or recreating your environment, restart your application to apply the changes.

## Verification

After applying the fix, the error should no longer occur. The application should now be able to run on Python 3.12 without any compatibility issues.
