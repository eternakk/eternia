# Release Management Process

This document outlines the release management process for the Eternia project, including versioning, release planning, testing, deployment, and post-release activities.

## Versioning Strategy

Eternia follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) for version numbering:

- **Major version** (X.0.0): Incompatible API changes or major feature additions
- **Minor version** (0.X.0): New features added in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch version** (0.0.X): Backward-compatible bug fixes and minor improvements

### Version Naming Conventions

- Release candidates: `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` (e.g., v1.2.0-rc.1)
- Beta releases: `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` (e.g., v1.2.0-beta.1)
- Alpha releases: `vX.Y.Z-alpha.N` (e.g., v1.2.0-alpha.1)
- Final releases: `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., v1.2.0)

## Release Planning

### Release Schedule

- **Major releases**: Scheduled every 6-12 months
- **Minor releases**: Scheduled every 1-3 months
- **Patch releases**: As needed for critical bug fixes

### Release Planning Process

1. **Feature Collection**: Collect and prioritize features and fixes for the upcoming release
2. **Release Scope Definition**: Define the scope of the release and create a release plan
3. **Timeline Establishment**: Set key milestones and deadlines for the release
4. **Resource Allocation**: Assign resources to implement features and fixes

## Development Process

### Feature Branches

All new features and significant changes should be developed in feature branches:

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/feature-name

# Push the feature branch to the remote repository
git push -u origin feature/feature-name
```

### Pull Requests

All changes must be submitted via pull requests:

1. Create a pull request from your feature branch to the `develop` branch
2. Ensure the pull request includes:
   - Description of changes
   - Link to related issues
   - Test cases
   - Documentation updates
3. Request code reviews from at least one team member
4. Address review comments
5. Merge the pull request once approved

## Testing Process

### Testing Levels

Each release must go through the following testing levels:

1. **Unit Testing**: Automated tests for individual components
2. **Integration Testing**: Tests for component interactions
3. **System Testing**: End-to-end tests of the entire system
4. **Performance Testing**: Tests for system performance under load
5. **Security Testing**: Vulnerability scanning and security assessments

### Release Candidate Testing

Before a final release:

1. Create a release candidate branch from `develop`
2. Deploy to a staging environment
3. Conduct thorough testing
4. Fix any critical issues found
5. Create a new release candidate if necessary
6. Repeat until no critical issues are found

## Release Preparation

### Release Branch Creation

When ready to prepare a release:

```bash
# Create a release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z
```

### Release Checklist

Complete the following checklist before releasing:

- [ ] All planned features and fixes are implemented
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Release notes are prepared
- [ ] Version numbers are updated in all relevant files
- [ ] Security scan is completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Deployment plan is reviewed

## Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment

1. Deploy the release candidate to the staging environment
2. Conduct final verification tests
3. Get stakeholder approval

### Production Deployment

1. Merge the release branch into `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git merge release/vX.Y.Z
   git push
   ```

2. Tag the release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

3. Deploy to production using the CI/CD pipeline

4. Merge the release branch back into `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git merge release/vX.Y.Z
   git push
   ```

### Deployment Verification

After deployment:

1. Verify the application is running correctly
2. Monitor logs and metrics for any issues
3. Conduct smoke tests to verify critical functionality

## Post-Release Activities

### Monitoring

Monitor the application for:

- Performance issues
- Error rates
- User feedback
- Security alerts

### Hotfixes

For critical issues discovered after release:

1. Create a hotfix branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b hotfix/vX.Y.Z+1
   ```

2. Implement and test the fix
3. Merge the hotfix branch into both `main` and `develop`
4. Create a new patch release

## Release Communication

### Internal Communication

- Notify all team members of the release
- Conduct a release retrospective to identify process improvements
- Update the project roadmap

### External Communication

- Publish release notes
- Update documentation
- Notify users of new features and changes
- Provide upgrade instructions if necessary

## Release Artifacts

The following artifacts should be created and archived for each release:

1. **Release Notes**: Detailed description of changes, new features, and bug fixes
2. **Installation Package**: Compiled binaries or deployment packages
3. **Source Code**: Tagged version in the repository
4. **Documentation**: User and technical documentation
5. **Test Reports**: Results of all tests conducted

## Release Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

1. Identify the issue and its impact
2. Decide whether to fix forward or roll back
3. If rolling back:
   - Deploy the previous stable version
   - Notify users of the rollback
   - Investigate and fix the issue
   - Prepare a new release

## Continuous Improvement

After each release:

1. Conduct a retrospective to identify what went well and what could be improved
2. Document lessons learned
3. Update the release process as needed
4. Implement improvements for the next release cycle
