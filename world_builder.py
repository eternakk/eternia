"""
ðŸŒŒ Eterna World Builder â€” Expanded Core

This module serves as the main entry point for building, simulating, and managing
the Eterna world. It has been refactored to use a more modular approach, with
functionality split into separate modules in the world_builder_modules package.

The module re-exports the key functions and classes from the world_builder_modules
package, making them available to other parts of the application.
