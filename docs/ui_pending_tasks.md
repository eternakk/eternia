   - Integrate Storybook with the development workflow
   - Create a process for adding new components to the library

## 4. Implement Lazy Loading for UI Components and Assets

### Current Status
The application loads most components eagerly, resulting in larger initial bundle size and slower load times.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Bundle Analysis**
   - Analyze the current bundle size using tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer
   - Identify large components and dependencies that can be lazy-loaded
   - Set targets for initial bundle size reduction

2. **Route-Based Code Splitting**
   - Implement React.lazy and Suspense for route-based code splitting
   - Create loading states for each lazy-loaded route
   - Ensure smooth transitions between routes

3. **Component-Level Code Splitting**
   - Identify large components that aren't immediately visible
   - Implement lazy loading for these components
   - Add fallback UI for loading states

4. **Asset Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for images using Intersection Observer
   - Optimize and compress images and other assets
   - Use appropriate image formats (WebP with fallbacks)

5. **Testing and Monitoring**
   - Test loading performance on various devices and network conditions
   - Monitor performance metrics in production
   - Adjust lazy loading strategy based on real-world performance data

## 5. Add Pagination or Virtualization for Large Data Sets in the UI

### Current Status
The UI currently loads all data at once, which can cause performance issues with large datasets.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Identify Components with Large Data Sets**
   - LogConsole: Can have thousands of log entries
   - AgentDashboard: May display many agents
   - ZoneViewer: May contain many entities
   - Any list or table components displaying large datasets

2. **Backend Pagination Support**
   - Implement API endpoints that support pagination parameters
   - Add sorting and filtering capabilities to reduce data volume
   - Ensure consistent data format for paginated responses

3. **UI Pagination Implementation**
   - Implement pagination controls for relevant components
   - Add infinite scrolling where appropriate
   - Implement state management for pagination (current page, items per page)

4. **Virtualization for Performance-Critical Components**
   - Implement react-window or react-virtualized for lists with many items
   - Apply virtualization to the LogConsole component
   - Optimize rendering for the ZoneCanvas component with many entities

5. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Test with realistic data volumes
   - Measure and optimize render performance
   - Ensure smooth scrolling and interaction with large datasets

## 6. Create User Documentation for the UI Components

### Current Status
Limited user-facing documentation exists for the UI components and their functionality.
