# Eternia Project

## Project Structure

The Eternia project follows a specific directory structure for organizing different types of files:

### Documentation
- `docs/`: Contains all project documentation in markdown format.
  - Architecture: `docs/architecture.md`
  - Developer Onboarding: `docs/developer_onboarding.md`
  - Running the Server: `docs/running_the_server.md`
  - UI Architecture: `docs/ui_architecture.md`
  - UI Components: `docs/ui_components.md`
  - UI Development Guidelines: `docs/ui_development_guidelines.md`
  - UI Pending Tasks: `docs/ui_pending_tasks.md`
  - Tasks: `docs/tasks.md`

### Data Storage
- `artifacts/`: Stores artifact files such as:
  - Authentication tokens
  - JWT secrets
  - User data
  - Governor state
  - Checkpoints
  - Profiling data

- `config/`: Contains configuration files and settings.

- `data/`: Stores database files and other persistent data.
  - The main database file is `data/eternia.db`

- `logs/`: Contains all log files generated by the application.
  - Main log file: `logs/eternia.log`
  - Cycle logs: `logs/eterna_cycles.log`
  - Governor events: `logs/governor_events.log`
  - Debug logs: `logs/debug.log`

### Code
- `modules/`: Core modules of the application.
- `services/`: Service components.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts.
- `tests/`: Test files.
- `ui/`: User interface components.

## Important Note on Data Storage

**Do not store data files in the `docs/` directory.** The `docs/` directory is reserved exclusively for documentation files.

All data files should be stored in their appropriate directories:
- Use `artifacts/` for artifact files
- Use `config/` for configuration files
- Use `data/` for database and other data files
- Use `logs/` for log files

The `.gitignore` file is configured to ignore these data directories to prevent large or sensitive files from being committed to the repository.

## Cleanup Script

A cleanup script (`cleanup_docs.sh`) is provided to remove any data directories that might have been mistakenly created in the `docs/` directory. Run it with:

```bash
./cleanup_docs.sh
```
