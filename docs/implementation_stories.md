# Implementation Stories & Task Breakdown

This document translates the design roadmap into narrative-style user stories with actionable task lists. Each story assumes alignment with the guiding principles in `docs/pending_implementation_design.md` and surfaces clear deliverables for team members or MCP agents.

## Epic A – Immersive World Interface

### Story A1 – As a world architect, I can render and edit Eternia in 3D
- Build WebGL/Three.js scene scaffolding that listens to simulation websocket streams.
- Map zone geometries, modifiers, and ritual nodes to visual assets with hover/tooltips.
- Implement terrain/physics editors backed by REST mutations guarded by the Alignment Governor.
- Provide undo/redo snapshots tied to checkpoint system and governor rollbacks.

### Story A2 – As a storyteller, I can choreograph narrative events visually
- Add timeline panel for staging events, emotions, and companion entrances.
- Create cinematic overlays for governor interventions, mythic rituals, and zone transitions.
- Export storyboards and recordings suitable for investor demos.

## Epic B – Embodied Companion Movement

### Story B1 – As a companion, I can traverse space with believable motion
- Extend backend models with position/velocity attributes and movement intents.
- Integrate pathfinding (navmesh/grid) and collision checks in the simulation loop.
- Broadcast movement updates through websocket channels with throttling.
- Visualize live routes and idle animations in the world interface.

### Story B2 – As the governor, I can veto unsafe movement
- Define safety constraints (restricted zones, hazardous modifiers) in config.
- Intercept movement intents, simulate outcomes, and issue allow/deny decisions.
- Surface governor judgments in UI with actionable user prompts.

## Epic C – Conversational Convergence

### Story C1 – As a creator, I can chat with agents and companions in one console
- Implement conversation bus service with persistence and rate limits.
- Build Mission Control chat UI supporting text, attachments, and commands.
- Integrate MCP agents, simulation companions, and human participants.

### Story C2 – As a data steward, I control how conversations train AI
- Capture transcripts with metadata (zone, emotional context, governor state).
- Add consent toggles and auditing workflow before logs enter training pipelines.
- Provide analytics on response latency, participation, and sentiment trends.

## Epic D – Security & Trust Foundations

### Story D1 – As a user, I secure my realm with two-factor auth
- Implement TOTP enrollment/verification endpoints and UI.
- Store encrypted secrets in artifacts vault with rotation ceremonies.
- Update auth flows to respect governor shutdown/rollback states.

### Story D2 – As a platform operator, I trace every sensitive action
- Introduce HMAC-signed request verification for privileged APIs.
- Emit structured audit logs to monitoring stack and retention policies.
- Add secure upload scanning with ClamAV microservice and quarantine review queue.

## Epic E – Data Intelligence & Analytics

### Story E1 – As an explorer, I export and analyze my Eternia journey
- Ship data export APIs for checkpoints, conversations, and metrics.
- Implement validation schemas shared between backend and TypeScript clients.
- Stand up analytics pipeline (Kafka/Redis + Dagster/Prefect) for behavior insights.

### Story E2 – As an overseer, I detect anomalies in real time
- Extend monitoring module with anomaly detection algorithms.
- Build Grafana dashboards and UI embeds for key metrics.
- Trigger governor pauses or alerts when thresholds breach narrative safety.

## Epic F – Autonomic Development Enablement

### Story F1 – As Mission Control, I orchestrate MCP agents safely
- Package task manifests referencing docs/tasks.md IDs and new epics.
- Provide sandboxed tools (planner, implementer, security, doc writer) with revocation logic.
- Hook conversation bus events into planner retrospectives and backlog refinement.

### Story F2 – As the organization, I demo production readiness to stakeholders
- Curate demo scripts combining 3D world, conversations, analytics dashboards.
- Produce funding-ready pitch materials summarizing feasibility milestones.
- Align deployment pipeline with security and analytics checkpoints for go-live.

**Usage Tips**
- Treat each story as a unit of work; break tasks further in issue trackers if needed.
- Reference `docs/pending_implementation_design.md` for technical depth and acceptance metrics.
- Update `docs/tasks.md` checkboxes when stories reach Definition of Done (tests, docs, security reviews).
